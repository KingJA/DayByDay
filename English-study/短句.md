* This project is deprecated in favor of RxJava and RxAndroid.
* As we already use RxJava and RxAndroid in the development, we decided to try out the Rx approach to implementation of event bus. Of course, we did our best to save a clean api driven by annotations and simple to use bus library like Otto.
* If you have any suggestions on how to improve the RxBus implementation, don’t hesitate to contact us.
